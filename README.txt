Topic - Cloud (WEB) Operation System.

Description - These is an operating system where you get a benefit to access from anywhere without the need of a network connection to a 
remote PC. If there is a private company and they want to use our operating system then it should be connect with the internally hosted 
private domain where all the user of that comapny can access their required application then it will be well secure, faster and relaiable for that company. It manages as well as it operates and executes the process of virtual infrastructure like virtual machines, virtual servers, hardware and software resources within the cloud environment. It is also known as Virtual Operating System. Cloud OS will allow to better usage of data center resources including network, storage and computing. It is designed to enhance the user or employee productivity and faster and better delivery of applications across the three clouds of private, public and hybrid with improved security and compliance. Cloud OS give access to the users to a variety of applications which will allow the users to complete simpler and light-end tasks without the need of developing a full-fledged operating system. There is a benefit of the stand-alone cloud operating system is that there is very less use of hardware in it and this will save your money.

Challenges - 
1) There was a one challanging thing regarding desktop that to show to user all apps and configuration that looks like desktop which was    one of the major challanging task for the us.   
2)Security issues is also an challanging task as every company has it own privacy and security. we are not able to see the exact           location where your data is stored or being processed. This increases the cloud computing risks that can arise during the               implementation or management of the cloud.
