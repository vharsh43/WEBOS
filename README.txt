Topic - Cloud (WEB) Operation System.

Description - These is an operating system where you get a benefit to access from anywhere without the need of a network connection to a 
remote PC. If there is a private company and they want to use our operating system then it should be connect with the internally hosted 
private domain where all the user of that comapny can access their required application then it will be well secure, faster and 
relaiable for that company. It manages as well as it operates and executes the process of virtual infrastructure like virtual machines, 
virtual servers, hardware and software resources within the cloud environment. It is also known as Virtual Operating System. Cloud OS 
will allow to better usage of data center resources including network, storage and computing. It is designed to enhance the user or 
employee productivity and faster and better delivery of applications across the three clouds of private, public and hybrid with improved 
security and compliance. Cloud OS give access to the users to a variety of applications which will allow the users to complete simpler 
and light-end tasks without the need of developing a full-fledged operating system. There is a benefit of the stand-alone cloud 
operating system is that there is very less use of hardware in it and this will save your money.

Challenges - 
1) There was a one challanging thing regarding desktop that to show to user all apps and configuration that looks like desktop which was 
   one of the major challanging task for the us.   
   
2) Security issues is also an challanging task as every company has it own privacy and security policies. we are not able to see the     
   exact location where your data is stored or being processed. This will increase the cloud computing risks that can arise at the time
   of the implementation or management of the cloud.

3) Lack of resources or expertise as there are more workloads in the cloud because of this reason any of the organization are having     
   issue with the tools or application.

4) Complaince is one the challanging issue facing in cloud computing. This issue is related backup services or cloud storage. Every     
   organization moves data from the internal storage to a cloud every time, it is faced with being compliant with industry regulations   
   and laws. Cloud cutomers have to look for the vendor that provide complaince which will help customer's company a lot.

5) Managing multiple clouds is also challanging issue facing in the cloud computing.

6) To build a private cloud is not the priority for every company as private solutions should be carefully addressed.

7) We think that one of the major issue is about migration which is faced computing industry. This process works when we move           
   application to cloud. There are few challanges we faced when we store data in the cloud are security challange, troubleshooting,     
   downtime for the application and many more.
   
   
Description to reporduce project - 
Cloud computing has been seen as one of the technology that give rise to the next-generation computing revolution and rapidly becomes the trending point in the ﬁeld of IT (Information Technology). As there is a fast movetowards Cloud computing has concerns on a some point for the success of information systems, virtualization, communication and integrity, scientiﬁc application, and information security. Therefore, cloud computing will be in great demand in coming years. In our operating system we are providing apps for user to work on it. They can use online this apps so they din't need to worry about their storage. However, in coming days we can add more software application for user's convience and any programmer can carry forward this operating system.
